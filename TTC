Teams Transcription Retention Policy Summary
Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive data governance policies implemented to ensure Microsoft Teams transcription files generated through Copilot are automatically deleted within 72 hours of creation. These measures protect sensitive organizational data while maintaining compliance with our retention requirements.
Policy Implementation
Our organization has implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure transcription files are properly managed and deleted within the required timeframe:
1. Default Retention Period
All transcription files generated by Copilot-enabled users are configured with a default 3-day retention period. This automated setting ensures files are marked for deletion immediately upon creation, eliminating the risk of manual oversight.
2. Microsoft Priority Clean Up
We have enabled Microsoft's Priority Clean Up feature, which applies retention metadata directly to transcription files. This metadata-level tagging ensures that even if files are moved, renamed, or modified by users, the 3-day retention period remains enforced at the system level.
3. Auto-Labeling and Information Protection
Microsoft Information Protection auto-labeling policies have been implemented to:

Automatically identify and classify transcription files
Apply encryption and protection controls
Prevent unauthorized actions including:

Cut operations
Copy operations
Paste operations
File editing



These protections ensure transcription content cannot be duplicated or extracted, maintaining data integrity throughout the retention period.
4. Automated Recycle Bin Management
An automated process monitors and permanently deletes transcription files from users' Recycle Bins once the 3-day retention period expires. This prevents users from recovering deleted transcription files beyond the approved timeframe.
